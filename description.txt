
goal was to make a book landing page that was the average of many landing pages I had seen. 
It was supposed to be flat, neat and safe.


NEW STUFF:
- generally responsive website with media queries;
- fixed navigation bar;
- basic rough dropdown menu;
- testimonials section with horizontal scrollbar and incompatible scrollbar property;
- contact form with: 
    - buttons changing display property,
    - input in words of thanks, else: a nice haiku,
    - erased input values after quitting the contact form;
- section with flexible elements and media-query-dependent order property;
- <img> with srcset & sizes;
